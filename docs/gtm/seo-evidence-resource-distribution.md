# Consent testing resource distribution

Prepared September 14, 2026. Drafts only; no messages sent. Release the web changes before using these public links.

## Resource

- Walkthrough: https://certscore.ai/guides/reject-consent-tracking-test
- Reusable worksheet: https://certscore.ai/resources/consent-audit-worksheet.md
- Full checklist: https://certscore.ai/guides/website-consent-audit-checklist

The resource explains the difference between a visible control, a completed Reject click, verified refusal, and subsequently observed requests. It gives teams a repeatable review record and cautions against treating unchanged storage as active tracking. It contains no invented case studies or new benchmark statistics.

## Distribution targets and drafts

### Agency and implementation partners

Use an existing business contact who owns CMP/tag-manager implementation; verify recipient and obtain send authorization. Do not buy a mailing list.

Subject: A reusable worksheet for testing tracking after Reject

We put together a practical Reject-testing walkthrough and an editable audit worksheet. They separate the click, the actual consent decision, and the requests that follow, so a hidden banner or an unchanged cookie does not become a misleading pass/fail result.

The worksheet includes the evidence fields an implementation team needs for a reproducible retest. You're welcome to reuse it with attribution:

If it is useful for your consent QA process, we'd welcome feedback or a reference from your implementation resources.

### Developer community post

Suggested channel: an appropriate Indie Hackers discussion or a community where the owner already participates. Follow the destination's self-promotion rules. Publish only after authorization.

Title: Why a disappearing cookie banner isn't enough to verify Reject

When testing a consent change, we separate four questions: Was the control visible? Did the click complete? Was refusal actually registered? Did a new tracking request begin afterward?

Those questions need different evidence. An in-flight request may predate the click, and a cookie can remain without being actively used. We documented a repeatable review process and shared a blank worksheet teams can reuse. It also records incomplete coverage explicitly instead of calling it a pass.

What do you include in a consent regression test before publishing tag-manager changes?

### Product social accounts

A Reject click, verified refusal, and a tracking request are three different pieces of evidence. Our walkthrough explains how to review them and includes a reusable consent audit worksheet for implementation teams.

Use utm_source=x for the X version. Do not claim that a scan proves compliance, or that the worksheet has been independently endorsed.

## Measure

Use these campaign links only for external distribution; internal links stay untagged. Review consented referral visits and scan completions, plus first-party external product activity. Record earned links only after verifying that an independent page actually links to the resource. Search Console can lag and does not enumerate every backlink. Target usefulness to a few relevant teams rather than a bulk link count.
